Daisy is one of the 3 fragments of the Ancient Dragon that also Geraint and Argenta came from. She is discovered accidentally by Professor K during an experiment to find a way to create immortal lifeforms. Unaware that the jewel he is using in his experiments was from a Dragon which Daisy was owner of and contained within, Professor K believes he had created her. He then adopts her as his granddaughter, and makes her believe that she has real parents who already perished.
