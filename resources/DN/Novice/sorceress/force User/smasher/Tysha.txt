Sorceress Tysha is a quest-giver located in Riverwort Wharf.

She was studying under the tutelage of Master Sorceress Stella for three years before traveling to Lotus Marsh for further studies. Since then, she had been giving quests to adventurers about clearing out threats in the area near the north region of Riverwort Wharf, notably Abyss-difficulty missions, claiming that it is for the sake of a cleaner and safer Lotus Marsh and the sake of Fairystar.
