Arc is a Fallen Elf Fruit, one of the type of elves that can be found in Mistland. On his own will, he decides to seek out the Player and teach them the arts of Awakening. Arc firmly believes that a resident from Lagendia would be the perfect candidate to use Awakening, as they are known in Mistland for being naturally goodwilled. Besides, Arc trust the Player will not discriminate him, as they didn't grow with the prejudice against Fallen Fruit Elves like Mistlanders. Arc claims to be the only person who knows how to use this power, but instead of using it on his own because of his frail body, he passes the knowledge to others.
