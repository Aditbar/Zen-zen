Cleric Jake was a member of the Cleric Order who is considered as the Player's closest friend (if the player's character is a Cleric). He was one of many who switched sides to the Dragon Followers, and was killed after being discovered for stealing important artifacts from the Dark Tower and Cleric Order.
