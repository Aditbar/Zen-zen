Tamara is the Sorceress trainer of Lotus Marsh. She was one of the disciples of Karacule, along with Stella and Lady Kayleen, and developed a rivalry with the latter. She eventually put a halt to her rivalry with the Court Sorceress as she decided to live peacefully in Lotus Marsh and become a "Family Woman". Unfortunately, and similarly to her teacher, Tamara is a horrible cook and her food is so bad it's been compared to poison.
